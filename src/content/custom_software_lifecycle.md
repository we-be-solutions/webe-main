Custom software might seem like a big leap—but understanding its lifecycle helps you take the first step with confidence. Knowing what to expect builds trust, sets realistic timelines, and creates the foundation for a strong partnership. If you're a non-technical decision maker looking to grow your business with tech, this guide is for you.

### 1. Discovery: Finding the Root Problem
The process begins with a discovery call—not to judge or overwhelm, but to understand. We start by identifying a single problem worth solving: one that takes a lot of manual time but doesn’t require much creativity or expertise. That’s your automation sweet spot.

We use this call to:
- Understand your business
- Identify high-ROI opportunities
- Begin building a working relationship

We’re not here to sell you an app—we’re here to make tech feel valuable and accessible.

### 2. Scoping: Capturing the Vision
After discovery, we distill the conversation into a clear project brief:
- One problem to solve
- A path to a solution
- Success criteria

We’ll scope it down to the biggest win and clearest return. This isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about creating focus. Smaller, well-defined projects create momentum, build trust, and give you something real to use (and get excited about).

### 3. Design: Bringing Ideas to Life
Depending on the project, we may sketch out flows, wireframes, or even clickable prototypes. The goal is mutual understanding: you should see what we see. Nothing begins until we’ve agreed on the design, the flow, and how we’ll measure success.

We use modern tools and formats that are easy to share and review. Our design phase is collaborative—your input isn’t just welcome, it’s essential.

### 4. Development: Building in Sprints
Once designs are approved, we move into development. We work in sprints based on a communication plan tailored to you. This keeps progress visible and feedback loops tight.

Small changes and refinements are expected during this phase. If major changes arise, we’ll pause and re-scope together—this is a partnership, not a black box.

### 5. Testing: Making Sure It Works
Testing is thorough and multi-layered:
- Manual testing on our side
- Live review with you
- A functional test suite that lives alongside your code

These tests aren’t just for quality—they're part of how we help you own your new software. A well-tested codebase is a real asset. If another developer ever takes over, they’ll thank you.

### 6. Handover: Your Software, Your Asset
Once testing is complete and the success criteria are met, we enter handover.

This includes:
- A walkthrough of your new software
- Access to your hosting environment (usually a cloud platform or hosting-as-a-service)
- Documentation and passing test reports
- Optional training
- Discussion of what’s next

You’ll know where your software lives, how it works, and how to grow it.

### 7. Post-Launch: Growing Together
Most of our clients come out of their first project full of ideas. That’s natural. Your first project isn’t the whole vision—it’s the first seed. We stay in touch and support you as your needs evolve.

Software isn’t a building—it’s a garden. It grows with you.

### Final Thoughts: Start Small, Think Big
Success in custom software isn’t about giant launches—it’s about communication, responsiveness, and solving one real problem at a time.

If you're thinking about custom software, start with one well-defined pain point. Let’s grow from there.

At WeBe, we keep you in the loop every step of the way. Open communication, technical excellence, and scoped-down wins are how we help you turn an idea into a tool your team relies on.
